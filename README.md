# Woodcorp – Order-to-Cash (O2C) Process Analysis
*Process Mining case study (DIS26a1) | Tool: Celonis | Team project (Jan Krings & Henri Moersheim)*

## Overview
Business-focused analysis of the Order-to-Cash (O2C) execution of a fictitious manufacturing company (Woodcorp).  
Using event data, we identify execution deviations, assess their business relevance, and derive improvement actions for operational process owners.

## Business Context
Woodcorp produces pallets and crates for retail and construction customers.  
Order changes after receipt (e.g., price changes or production start date changes) increase planning uncertainty and operational effort.  
This project focuses on where these deviations occur and which of them matter most.

## Core Question
**Where does the real O2C execution deviate from the intended flow, and which deviations should be prioritized for improvement?**

## Scope
**In scope:** Order received → Order changes → Start of production  
**Out of scope:** Billing, payment, returns

## Approach
- Defined a **Happy Path** as an analytical baseline  
- Identified and quantified **Execution Gaps** (volume, time impact, business relevance)  
- Analyzed root causes across product, plant, and customer segments  
- Derived improvement actions and a lean control concept (KPIs)

## Deliverables
- Stakeholder-ready slide deck (PDF) in `/slides` *(to be added)*  
- Selected dashboard screenshots in `/assets/screenshots` *(to be added)*  
- Project documentation in `/docs`

## Our Role
Data Analysts

We:
- framed the business question and analytical scope  
- defined the Happy Path and key operational KPIs  
- analyzed execution deviations based on event data  
- quantified their relevance (volume and time impact)  
- translated findings into stakeholder-ready insights and recommendations  

## Data Availability
The dataset is not included in this repository. Please do not commit any raw data files.

## Status
Work in progress – findings and deliverables will be added step by step.
