# Methodology

This document describes the analytical approach applied in this project.
The focus is on **business-oriented process analysis** and transparent decision logic.

---

## Analytical Framing

The analysis is guided by a management-oriented question:

Where does the actual Order-to-Cash (O2C) execution deviate from the intended operational flow, and which deviations are relevant from a business perspective?

To ensure structured analysis, the project follows the Celonis Enhancement Cycle:
Identify → Quantify → Analyze → Improve → Control.

## Happy Path Definition

A simplified Happy Path is defined as an analytical baseline representing the intended execution flow:

- ... 
- ... 
- ... 

The Happy Path is not intended as a normative process model, but as a **reference** to identify and compare execution deviations.

---

## Execution Gaps

Execution Gaps are defined as observable deviations from the Happy Path in actual process execution.

Typical examples include:
- ...

At this stage, Execution Gaps are treated as **symptoms**, not as root causes.

---

## Quantification Logic

Each identified Execution Gap is assessed using a consistent structure:

- affected order volume  
- additional cycle time compared to the Happy Path  
- qualitative business relevance (e.g. planning effort, operational risk)

This allows objective comparison and supports data-driven prioritization.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

Root cause analysis is performed only for prioritized Execution Gaps.

The focus is on identifying **systematic patterns** across business dimensions such as:
- product type  
- production plant  
- customer segment  

Isolated outliers are explicitly excluded from root cause conclusions.

---

## Improvement & Control Logic

Improvement measures are derived directly from validated root causes.
Measures are evaluated based on expected business impact and implementation effort.

A small set of operational KPIs is defined to monitor execution behavior over time and support continuous improvement.
